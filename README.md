> 🌙 Moon+ Reader Highlights - Store and control your bookmarks from application

**Moon+ Reader** is an Android EBook with more than **10+** millions of downloads. But it still has some syncing issues.

One of methods to sync highlights or bookmarks from EBook is to use [Readwise.io](https://readwise.io/) service which give you only 30 days of free usage.
This project aim to remove the **third party** service and give to user all control on his notes.
